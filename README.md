This is the paper with the like easiest variant of DQN maybe worth reading
but there are more intuitive explanations online
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602 


for example 
https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html

We dont need to do DQN there a ton of cooler methods like actor-critic and
proximal policy optimization but they are slightly more in depth
